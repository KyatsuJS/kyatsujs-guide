# Discord application

## Creating your application

The first place you need to go is the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Then, connect to your Discord account in the upper right corner. You should appear in a page that looks like that:

<div align="left">

</div>

Kyatsu (in the above image) is an application we made. There is probably nothing to display in your screen if you didn't have made any Discord bot.

Then, just click the blue button "New Application", give a name to your application and accept the terms. Once you did, select create.

</div>

Then, click on the application you created to arrive in the main page. On this page, you are able to customize your application with a profile picture, description, links for terms, and other. But for now we want to create a bot which we can invite in our server.

## Configuring the bot&#x20;

Just select the "Bot" tab, in the right navigation menu.

<div align="left">

</div>

Here you will find all the data that involves your bot. You can put a profile picture if you want your bot to have one.

For the moment, we will only take a look on the three last checkers.

For the moment, enable them all. You will learn more about Privileged Gateway Intents further in this guide. Don't forget to save if it's not done.

Then, the third and the last part is to invite our bot into a Discord server to test it. You can create one or use an existing one; it doesn't matter. To do that, go to the OAuth2 > URL Generator menu.

## Inviting the bot

Once you're on this page, a huge grid appears. Don't panic and listen to us. Select the `bot` and the `application.commands` scopes.

</div>

Then, in the table that appears below this first one, check the permissions you want to give per default to your bot. In the bottom of the page, the custom link will appear. Copy in and paste it in your web browser.

Select the server you want your bot to be in.

Congrats ! Your bot is now on your Discord server. Now, you need to code !
