# Initializing our project

## Creating the main directory

Open a file explorer and place yourself in the directory where you want your project folder to be.

<div align="left" data-full-width="false">

</div>

Then, create an empty folder. We are going to make our source code and place it in this folder. Open the folder you just created in your IDE. For my case, it will be IntelliJ IDEA.

Create a main.js file in the root of the project, this file is our main JavaScript file.

We are ready to start our project ! Open a terminal or a command prompt focused on your project directory.

Enter this command to initialize our project from NPM:

```bash
npm init
```

You can also start it with PNPM or YARN. Some fields appear one by one, fill it as you want. If you don't know what to write here, let it empty. You can see now a package.json file in your project ! It will include all the data and information about your project.

Now, the next step is to install KyatsuJS.
