## You must have JavaScript knowledge

It seems obvious, but before making a Discord bot with KyatsuJS you need to know how to write code with JavaScript because this guide won't talk about it. It's an important warning, without any knowledge you might misunderstand KyatsuJS examples code explanations.

## You must have a Discord account

Again, it seems dumb, but we must specify it. Has anyone ever imagined making a Discord bot without an account ?

## You must have Node.js installed and a package manager

If you don't have Node.js and/or a package manager, take a look at [this pretty simple goodly friendly amazingly well written guide web page](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Once everything is good, you can start with the following page. :)
